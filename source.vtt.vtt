1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:15.470
Sarah Hofmeyer: Great. Well, I've kind of been starting these interviews by just kind of trying to get to know each other, and I wanted to ask first how your interest in food systems kind of sparked and grew for you personally and professionally.

2
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.950
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, I think

3
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:27.880
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like going way back, My interest in food systems probably started just growing up with a mom who gardens and had.

4
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.670
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, we we were always rolling food, and she she also ran a flower business out of a kind of backyard farm garden, selling at the local farmers market.

5
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.580
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So

6
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.160
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that was just kind of part of our family culture. She also.

7
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I I grew up in Fairfield, Iowa, which is a small town in southeast Iowa. Are you familiar with their field

8
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.420
Sarah Hofmeyer: southeast? No; but I'm. From the exact opposite part of the State Northwest Iowa.

9
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.100
Sarah Hofmeyer: So I just had to quick thing for a second if I ever ever been there. But I don't think so.

10
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.910
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Okay, it's a unique little small town where there is a lot of interest in sustainable agriculture and

11
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): organic food at a time that that wasn't like a popular trendy thing, so

12
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.200
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): which she. We had some family friends that ran a Csa farm, and she would help out with that. So she always believed that

13
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.780
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): part of our health care as

14
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): a family was eating, eating local food, fresh food, organic.

15
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.240
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so

16
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.410
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that that's like the root of of lion, care about and work in this, and then I went to Grinnell College.

17
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.430
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Okay.

18
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.380
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So when I was there it was a time when there was a lot of interest in

19
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.570
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): local food

20
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.590
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): generally. So there was a campus garden and and different

21
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.910
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): there. There was an eco house that there was just like a lot of opportunities to plug into kind of

22
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.740
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): different local and sustainable agriculture thing, so that I think I just kind of naturally based on my background. Gravity gravitated towards

23
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.250
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): doing as much as I could to integrate food into my my college. Yes.

24
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:30.150
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and then I, When I was at Cornell I did an internship with cultivate Kansas City at the time. It was Kansas City Center for urban agriculture. I spent a summer in Kansas City and just really loved the organization and the work, and it just

25
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): me made sense for me. based on that that family

26
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:48.550
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): background I should mention. We also, as part of our my mom's flower business at the farmers market kind of evolved into also doing prepared food sales at our little farmers market in town. So we

27
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.410
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): would

28
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): buy seasonal produce from the different vendors, and make sandwiches and wraps and process all and stuff so like

29
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.210
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): all through middle and high school, my sister and I. That was our

30
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.010
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): our summer summer little business income, too. So so it's just.

31
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:23.290
Sarah Hofmeyer: I can really remember. Yeah, make some a local vegetarian sushi, and that's awesome. Honestly, also, just coming from Iowa. That's really neat, too, because it's such a highly industrialized tag state

32
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.100
Sarah Hofmeyer: to be doing organic at that period in time. And that kind of interest that's awesome. Yeah.

33
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:44.890
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah. Are you familiar with hairfield at all? No. At this point i'm like, I gotta Google this later. Yeah, you'll find some weird stuff. It's the home of transcendental meditation, a transcendental meditation based community.

34
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:55.960
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So about a third of the population of 10,000 has moved there to be part of this. a community of people who meditate. And there's a university based in that. And

35
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:07.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah. So I went to a school for most of my life, where we meditated every day. But sort of part of that culture. Was this: like interest in organic food.

36
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.550
sustainability?

37
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.550
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah. And like food as prescription. In some way it sounds like the health care. That's so.

38
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.680
Sarah Hofmeyer: And what a nice

39
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:28.430
Sarah Hofmeyer: I was reading! Obviously on. Cultivate Casey's website about before they were. Cultivate Casey. So it sounds like you were there kind of at a a ground level point, almost.

40
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.940
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. So I I did an internship in 2,008 for the summer, and then I came back in 2,010 after I graduated

41
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and worked in a

42
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:51.680
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like, probably 3 or 4 different job titles between 2,010, and the end of 2,016, and then I left. I was just. I had been there for a long time

43
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.560
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): straight out of college.

44
00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:06.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): was ready to try some different things ended up working in a community development nonprofit in Kansas City more environmentally focused nonprofit and campus city, and then

45
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.850
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): just started that about a year and a half ago.

46
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.720
Sarah Hofmeyer: Me

47
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.910
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So

48
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.530
Sarah Hofmeyer: so

49
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.830
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): at food systems are just my passion and and I

50
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.290
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it. It was a I had an opportunity to to go back in that direction, and it was a good time.

51
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): That's not true. It wasn't a good time, but it was what I was more excited about

52
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.210
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that. Then the rolling was in at the time. So

53
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.340
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, that's the

54
00:05:45.660 --> 00:06:00.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): you know. I'm super Well, that's fine. Also another like element of my my work in food systems is I founded Long Fellow Farm, which is a neighborhood farm.

55
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): It's all volunteer rooms, including

56
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.290
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): my involvement from the beginning.

57
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So in my spare time I

58
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.380
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): organize and have for

59
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): will be our ninth season.

60
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.490
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): a community run farm.

61
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.060
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): just a couple of block block from my house. and it's land that our Neighborhood association owns.

62
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.010
Sarah Hofmeyer: I was just going to ask. So how did the land come to be?

63
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.890
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, it's. The neighborhood worked to

64
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.050
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): get some apartments that were in really rough shape, torn down, and then

65
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:52.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it was sold to a developer that didn't just that kind of abandoned the project in 2,008, when everything crashed, and then the neighborhood worked to get the land back, and

66
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.270
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and I moved into the neighborhood in 2,014 that had just been sitting

67
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.710
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): as kind of community green space that wasn't really being used.

68
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:11.380
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So we started at a neighborhood farm. That's awesome. Where is that in Kansas City then? Or

69
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.030
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, it's at thirtieth and Harrison in midtown, Kansas City.

70
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.880
Sarah Hofmeyer: That is really neat.

71
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:25.340
Sarah Hofmeyer: I've been so excited to talk to you, because from what like little Internet searching and creeping, I've done it like

72
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:33.040
Sarah Hofmeyer: your experience is exactly what i'm really interested in hearing about, which is kind of how

73
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.140
Sarah Hofmeyer: some of the policies around Urban AD kind of changed and shifted, or how they haven't.

74
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:49.740
Sarah Hofmeyer: and where, if there's any burden that's associated with those policies for urban farmers just trying to learn about that and see

75
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.510
Sarah Hofmeyer: because I've talked to a lot of

76
00:07:51.530 --> 00:08:05.290
Sarah Hofmeyer: I I know I I've talked to several people who have said bits and pieces about their being burden in municipal policy toward growing food in the city. But a fair amount of them have actually said that it's improved quite a bit

77
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:18.270
Sarah Hofmeyer: because of cultivate cases work. And so not only were you there during the period and time where people have talked about these shifts being made. But you run a farm to this day, so I would love to hear more about

78
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.960
Sarah Hofmeyer: historically how you've seen that change or not change.

79
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:32.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. So you're just to make sure. I'm speaking exactly to what you're You're interested in that like the city donning codes.

80
00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.020
That that type of stuff, is, it's the this area.

81
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:48.780
Sarah Hofmeyer: yeah, like running into the city and county regulations, and both in terms of like your experience as a farmer, but also, maybe in those various positions. How you've heard about others experiences.

82
00:08:49.340 --> 00:09:02.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. So okay, Kansas City of Kansas City, Missouri did change zoning codes in 2,010. And that was right around when I was back at the where it had like kind of just gone through the big push

83
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.670
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to get that changed when I started back

84
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): or started that hopefully, Kansas City full time

85
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.730
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that came about. Do you know much about how that came about? Or do you want that?

86
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.300
Sarah Hofmeyer: I have heard bits and pieces about.

87
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:28.650
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah, yeah, a few different people. But please, as if I didn't know I would love to hear.

88
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.850
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But you know okay? Well, what so what I know is that that she was running into issues running a Csa out of the backyard

89
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:47.800
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): farm in a residential area. Neighbors, we're complaining about the traffic and the the business use in a residential area. The it the farmer used in a residential area.

90
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): And so that was kind of this for for

91
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.350
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): working on the zoning codes. so based on the context of

92
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:11.830
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): why and how that came about, and the time I, my understanding that there was a lot of opposition from realtors and and some some city council saying, like, you know.

93
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:18.650
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): urban farms are destroying property values, and you know this is, we can't have this in our city. So

94
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:30.270
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): based on that opposition like there was over overall support for urban agriculture and making codes friendly. But but with the context of that opposition that codes were not as

95
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.990
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): strong as it could have been.

96
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.260
So it is

97
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.350
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): currently on the the of the Greater Kansas City food policy coalition

98
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.260
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to revisit Kansas City, Missouri

99
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Urban I

100
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.980
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): ordinances and continue to improve.

101
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So like there are still things that are like pretty restrictive around onsite sales of

102
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.500
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): okay

103
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.400
produce.

104
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.490
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): There are

105
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:07.740
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): things that are still pretty restrictive, or require burden around like access accessory structures

106
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like having to.

107
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.350
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): even if they're more temporary and like

108
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.460
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): off the record, a lot of farms just like

109
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.370
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): build things that are more temporary, high tunnels and

110
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): wash stands or put in and sort of shed

111
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.480
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that without going through the

112
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.670
for channels.

113
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:47.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, I've heard a lot of the ask for goodness later. So off the record. Not not voted to me. That's definitely an approach, and that's an approach with onsite sales, too. I mean some of the most

114
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.920
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): visible urban farms are

115
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.650
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): doing things that are absolutely not allowed under the current coordinates.

116
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:07.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and everybody loves them, and it's great. And let's change the ordinance before it becomes an issue for them. It's kind of the

117
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:13.480
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): what we're hoping to do over the next year or 2 with the

118
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): greater chasing.

119
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.760
Also collision.

120
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I assume you've talked to Andrea.

121
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:36.010
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah, I had an internship at Kc. Healthy kids for a summer when I was kind of, I think we might have it's just been so long it was like 2020. It was right during Covid. Okay, maybe not. And that's when I was out of

122
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:43.130
Sarah Hofmeyer: okay. I remember one of the urban farmers being Neil and

123
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.610
Sarah Hofmeyer: a few other people from Mark. But yeah, i'm not sure

124
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.030
it was.

125
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.550
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I was at bridging the gap of it. So

126
00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:00.080
Sarah Hofmeyer: So it sounds like some of these examples. I'm kind of curious

127
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:10.370
Sarah Hofmeyer: what we're what was it like before? The more conference of zoning changes were made? It just like nothing was allowed by right basically at all.

128
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.780
Sarah Hofmeyer: or

129
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.790
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I I don't first like totally No, because I was

130
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:25.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like just getting started as it changed. But you my understanding is yes, like nothing was allowed by right

131
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and

132
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.960
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but kind of similar to how it still is like a lot of things we're happening.

133
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:39.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): They just we're kind of under the radar. And

134
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.250
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, and and obviously like, then things would come up where it presented an issue for the farms.

135
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.240
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Okay.

136
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.650
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but that I mean, really, I think this kind of

137
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): based is when any any issues would come up.

138
00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.610
Sarah Hofmeyer: That's what it sounds like.

139
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.960
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Now. Kansas City, Kansas is an entirely different

140
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.420
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): story.

141
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:14.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): as our like all the other, like one of the things that's really complicated about Kansas City area is there's Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas, and then, like

142
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:23.050
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): dozens of other tiny municipalities that all have their own regulations and zoning codes ordinances, so

143
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.600
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): i'm.

144
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:33.990
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We do have a spreadsheet that has kind of it hasn't been updated in a few years. But has

145
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.220
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): have you seen that?

146
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:48.370
Sarah Hofmeyer: That's I think that's what I worked on. I believe, when I was in turning, I went to, you know all the different surrounding suburb cities to their quotes of ordinances, and filled out spreadsheets. So I think it might be

147
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:54.100
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it. It might be the same thing. It's like a planning and zoning

148
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.620
Sarah Hofmeyer: scorecard. Almost.

149
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Okay. huh? So you did it with Casey. How the kids

150
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:10.210
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we're with. Okay. because I think cultivate has one that that was developed separately, but maybe it wasn't. Maybe it. It's yours.

151
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:24.290
Sarah Hofmeyer: and it's funny, because for my dissertation i'm going to use the 2,020 version to potentially refill out to see if there have been changes, and also to have as control variables for me. So it might be updated soon.

152
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.680
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Okay. Great: yeah. Yeah.

153
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.780
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, as far as I know.

154
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:41.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But I I don't know all the municipalities like Probably not much has changed, especially in like particular timeframe, and the focus is

155
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.040
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): of local governments. It's been very much

156
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.310
Sarah Hofmeyer: Covid focused. And

157
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.350
yeah.

158
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.530
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that's what else. Not urban agriculture.

159
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.680
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. So

160
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.200
Sarah Hofmeyer: So I wanted to go back and ask you a little bit more.

161
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:06.400
Sarah Hofmeyer: I, too, have heard about the onsite sales and accessory structure issues with

162
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:18.170
Sarah Hofmeyer: It's not considered in code at all, where yes, you can grow the produce, but you can't add value. You can't sell it. You can't have volunteers so like you effectively can't

163
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.420
Sarah Hofmeyer: potentially do the things you need to do to run your farm.

164
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.710
Sarah Hofmeyer: But i'm kind of curious. Are there any other areas that you've heard

165
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.120
Sarah Hofmeyer: just from other people's experiences being burdensome.

166
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.420
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, okay.

167
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.050
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): thinking about.

168
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.360
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): If I

169
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:46.100
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): there are a number of graduates from the new routes for refugees program who have wanted to keep chickens

170
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.040
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and

171
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): basically any special they need a special use. Permit to do that.

172
00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.410
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): even if it's under. And I don't know the designated number in why not county, but I could find out.

173
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.089
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But even for that they need especially use for me.

174
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.770
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and the process to get a special use permit is the same for

175
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:20.410
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 20 chickens as it is, for, like a variance on the massive building. So a huge amount of paperwork going to public holding public meetings, maybe

176
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:27.030
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): going to community meetings. Apparently one of the farmers had to like stay at a meeting until midnight

177
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.280
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to like get

178
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.510
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): his special use permanent for his handful of chickens.

179
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:34.780
Sarah Hofmeyer: I

180
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So that's a a particular one that brought up a lot within our

181
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.510
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): new routes team, but similar

182
00:17:43.780 --> 00:18:00.050
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): for construction of it, like high tunnels or or other accessory structures that they require that that same special use permit process. So we, as as an organization building at the gym for Gardens training farm and

183
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:08.340
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): working with a lot of the refugee farmers who have purchase land or found land and are are developing their own farm sites.

184
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:15.880
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I haven't been the person working directly with them through that process. So this is all kind of second hand from from other staff members.

185
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.240
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but

186
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:27.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): the the that special use permit process. It's. It's almost like there's different. They're seeing different directions on the website than they're hearing from

187
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.380
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): city staff that they're working with and it's just a very confusing and complicated process.

188
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:38.770
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): especially if you don't speak English. You don't understand the systems. Oh, yeah.

189
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.420
Sarah Hofmeyer: that that's what I was going to ask you about is, what is that like for them being refugees and having that be their position in the encounter.

190
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I say I mean everything that I

191
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): No, we like we have had stuff

192
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.820
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): working through that process with them with translators

193
00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.980
Sarah Hofmeyer: awesome.

194
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.270
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so that

195
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I don't want to say it's it's good that we're able to do that.

196
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but

197
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.600
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that we need to do that so

198
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.820
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): especially for and for things like

199
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:26.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 20 chickens. Could there be a streamline process that you, even if they still need a special use. Permit the process. That's

200
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.190
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): because

201
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.010
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): similar to what I said about

202
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.280
Well.

203
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.360
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): this process doesn't make. We're just gonna

204
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): do some do what we need to do. Alright. So

205
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:59.810
Sarah Hofmeyer: so it sounds like, Cultivate Casey works, I I mean, within the region, so that's wine Dot County and Kansas City, Missouri. Are there any other like striking examples from in the area

206
00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.170
Sarah Hofmeyer: to come to mind?

207
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:10.740
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I know we worked with some people in independence

208
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.660
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): around the high tunnel. I that was

209
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:21.770
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): my predecessor in this position that worked with that that farmer. So I don't have the details of that, but I know it was a

210
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): process to get get approved. And then

211
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.890
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that same pro was running into issues with just like

212
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): codes, inspectors. as far as the condition of the

213
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.750
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): at the site. That was

214
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.560
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): last summer I was in communication with him, but it's

215
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and and I would say, that's again more of a complaint based

216
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:53.750
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like a lot of urban farms could in theory get still get in trouble on

217
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.980
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): codes inspections, especially where there is a lack of understanding and familiarity with like

218
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:11.790
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): what is native, edible, landscaping look like what is a a farm. but like the neighborhood farm, I've run also got in trouble. We got it

219
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): citation for like the rank leads over

220
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.700
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 24 inches, or whatever 8 inches.

221
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.740
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and it was like right after the first freeze.

222
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Everything

223
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.610
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like had just died, and it was a neighbor that was pissed off because there were homeless people sitting at our picnic tables.

224
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:42.770
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and they just wanted to. Fortunately that May group is out and is long gone, and I like, called

225
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.500
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): the Codes inspector on the letter like 10 times, and never heard that, and then it just kind of went away.

226
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so I don't know it's just like

227
00:21:53.750 --> 00:22:00.870
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): there is a big. and we never would have gotten that. That letter had a neighbor not complained.

228
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:07.070
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah. right. That kind of attitude is what drives the city coming out to see

229
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.490
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): what's happening.

230
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.390
Sarah Hofmeyer: Did you have any

231
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.780
Sarah Hofmeyer: any other issues while you were kind of getting that started.

232
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:22.390
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): or, you know, constructing a fence, or when you're starting to with your cell phone, which

233
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): for better or worse, there's no fence

234
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.850
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I we got. I mean the biggest.

235
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:39.380
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): A I'm expense for any startup is installing water. Fortunately, Casey Mo has a Grant program

236
00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:47.880
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): funded through the city of Kansas City's Water Department that supports farms and gardens with water access.

237
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:57.480
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So that's a huge asset for Kansas City, Missouri. It's not available in Kansas City, Kansas. or other areas.

238
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Okay. at the time that that program started.

239
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): why not? Counting also started one. It was like H. 2 to grow in that county, and

240
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Casey grow, in case, you know.

241
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.950
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But after a few years the h 2 over growing

242
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:25.150
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): what Co. Stopped, and I don't know why I don't. I think they started as a pilot, and for whatever reason to continue it.

243
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.430
Sarah Hofmeyer: it's interesting.

244
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So that's a little bit different. Then. then, very like

245
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): policy berries, but still something that

246
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.440
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): needs to be considered around urban agriculture.

247
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): How can cities support that water access?

248
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:53.410
Sarah Hofmeyer: Exactly. I've heard so much about the water and land access to, and just as a little clarification. I definitely am interested in it because

249
00:23:53.800 --> 00:24:08.520
Sarah Hofmeyer: I'm. There are the barriers for sure that i'm interested in, but also I want to know what farmers go through when they encounter government, and how it creates burden, how learning about something.

250
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:21.420
Sarah Hofmeyer: learning about the requirements complying with it the psychological toll. It puts on people so all of those examples are just laid in with it, and it's really it's interesting to me, and it's the kind of thing that.

251
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.000
Sarah Hofmeyer: not having thoughtful policy creates, even in the case of like Kansas City, where

252
00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.860
Sarah Hofmeyer: they

253
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:34.300
Sarah Hofmeyer: did do more, enabling zoning code. But there's still these little hiccups that become big hiccups for people.

254
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.530
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah, and it's definitely

255
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:50.260
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, the the psychological tool is Yes. important. And yeah. i'm glad you

256
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.360
about that.

257
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.900
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah, I would like to talk more with.

258
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.540
Sarah Hofmeyer: I'm, hoping to talk more with farmers to hear more about their experiences. But

259
00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.810
Sarah Hofmeyer: if you have any other

260
00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:07.770
Sarah Hofmeyer: examples and thoughts around like psychological costs, that I would love to hear what you think.

261
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, I need to think about that a little bit. So another

262
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.750
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I mean, land access is obviously an a major issue as well.

263
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.460
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I don't know if you've seen, cultivate is currently in the process of dealing with

264
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.900
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): relocation of our Westport Commons farm.

265
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.160
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): because the developers are planning. Have you seen that

266
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.460
Sarah Hofmeyer: I saw that you were moving it? But I didn't know why

267
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.920
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I mean Essentially it is privately held property. And

268
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.800
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we have a 25 year lease, but it has a relocation clause in it.

269
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.580
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So

270
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.480
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah.

271
00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:07.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So the developer plans to build apartments, and when I send you a a link to this article that just came out. It's there. So what we were in the City Plan Commission Meeting this week.

272
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.810
closing

273
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): the the amendment that they need to go through.

274
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:23.000
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but I mean so. This is like I don't want to speak to you to it too much, because it's like still very active and up in the air.

275
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.170
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but

276
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): just that kind of walking the line between.

277
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:35.770
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We have to work with the developers because there are landlords, and we need them to honor their

278
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): agreement in the least to help

279
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.090
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): pay for some of the relocation costs.

280
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.030
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Oh, and

281
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we need to consider. The best interest of the organization. Is that just

282
00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.470
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): making the decision to move now versus by and

283
00:26:54.130 --> 00:27:00.670
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): not know if we're gonna stay, we go and then make it potentially harder to leave.

284
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.650
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So so the

285
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.460
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): amendment that the developer was requesting past the City Plan Commission

286
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.460
forward to

287
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.920
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): there was some good, and and it's a particularly complicated case, because it was the school

288
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.710
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): building that had to go through a a public

289
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:29.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): process to decide who got the right to purchase it. I don't know if you're familiar with that whole process. But

290
00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): basically cultivate was a big part of the vision that was sold to the community

291
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.690
Sarah Hofmeyer: for the developers to be able to purchase that building.

292
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:45.990
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but after few years, then the school district releases all the restrictions from the site. and now they're

293
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.940
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so. It's like it's more complicated than just like cultivate losing the family. And

294
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, and our only

295
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:56.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so

296
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it's a very active

297
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.970
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): situation where we're dealing with at the moment. And Don't

298
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.210
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): totally know what the next steps are, as far as how much

299
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.990
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we're going to put into fighting to stay on that land or not.

300
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:21.500
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But there might be opportunities to show up at city council meetings in the next couple of weeks.

301
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.970
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So i'm thinking about like, what is

302
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.970
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): what is our response to this situation mean for other urban farmers that

303
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:43.260
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): will find themselves in similar situations. As the city continues to develop and trying to be like. Well. we would go out and fight for another farm.

304
00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Do we need to fight for for our own farm, too, like

305
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.440
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so I don't know how to like.

306
00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:06.000
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I probably said more than I should say about the situation. So I will quote you on anything. I'm. Just it's interesting to hear about

307
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:16.390
Sarah Hofmeyer: how those processes bring together so many different, like categories of actors like developers like you're saying in realtors, what was the

308
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:30.190
Sarah Hofmeyer: so going to like the City Commission meeting or planning commission meetings? Not just maybe this individual and you're talking about. I'm sure you've been to others and had to deal with cities and a lot of different

309
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.170
Sarah Hofmeyer: ways.

310
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.800
Sarah Hofmeyer: What is the sense you get

311
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:40.500
Sarah Hofmeyer: of their appreciation, value, knowledge about urban agriculture, and what food does in the city

312
00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:47.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): or for people in the city. I guess I think it's a really mixed bag.

313
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.250
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So, speaking specifically to this

314
00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:56.010
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): City Plan Commission Meeting. there were 6

315
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.230
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Commissioners present for the case

316
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.130
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to a post like we're in support of us, for

317
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we're yeah supported to approve this.

318
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:13.200
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): There we were different reasons for that. Some of it was like

319
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:20.830
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): one of them was not necessarily like. I think the farm should be here, or it wasn't necessarily about the urban agriculture as much as it was about the

320
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.890
which of the developers.

321
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.580
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and that the intention of the school district

322
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): releasing those restriction was wasn't.

323
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): They saw that there was a 25 year lease in place, and they thought that was sufficient to protect them

324
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:50.890
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): when they release that restriction. So that was kind of his position. Another one was very clearly like thoughtful about climate change, and that the city has these climate, action, plans, and

325
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.560
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): green space is important to that. So

326
00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:00.790
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I think he was looking through that lens and and seeing more value in in the green space.

327
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): And the so it was. It was mixed.

328
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.990
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and I don't and I think others were more like

329
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.760
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Well, this isn't the the least agreement is not what we're looking at.

330
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.090
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): That's not our place to comment on. It's

331
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.260
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): this bigger picture of land use, and and

332
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.370
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): even within that, like they're they're choosing sides.

333
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.370
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and also like what it. What do we have? The the right to

334
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to decide on as a city Plan commission?

335
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.090
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): No.

336
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.690
Sarah Hofmeyer: What

337
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:47.560
Sarah Hofmeyer: of those people who were in opposition? What were some of their justifications or reasoning

338
00:31:47.840 --> 00:32:01.830
Sarah Hofmeyer: like? Obviously, you said the thing the thing about. you know this is this part isn't our issue to comment on. But is it just the sense that we want this economic development in the form of whatever building they're going to construct.

339
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.050
Sarah Hofmeyer: or

340
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.680
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I I think that was primarily it.

341
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:15.560
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I mean it. Yeah, I kind of assume, if I didn't want to, just in case someone had a more nuanced opposition.

342
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.100
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Not really.

343
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.030
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah.

344
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.380
Sarah Hofmeyer: Okay.

345
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.340
Sarah Hofmeyer: So I guess

346
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:45.750
Sarah Hofmeyer: I want to shift a little bit and kind of move backward and ask about the different hats you've played or put on at Cultivate, Kc: You mentioned that you've had a few different job titles. Have you worked in like pretty different capacities?

347
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.930
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. So I started out in like

348
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.660
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): the

349
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.980
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): this is program assistant, just like general, whatever

350
00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:08.610
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): whatever needed to be done and that evolved into like community outreach coordinator. and then communications and outreach manager, and and both of those roles we're doing a lot of

351
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): event planning like I don't know if you ever were familiar with the urban ground tour. It was a big tour of farms and gardens.

352
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:23.800
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so I plan to that for many years between like 2010, and 20,

353
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 15

354
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.800
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): then, and then a lot of volunteer management.

355
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.190
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): all the for I'm not doing

356
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:44.580
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that now. Social media. Newsletters website a lot of that stuff in my first, and then

357
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.110
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): the last year I was at Cultivate.

358
00:33:49.780 --> 00:34:01.930
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I was. I was focused on this Westport project before it became the West Part Commons farm, like. We knew we were moving in that direction, and I was doing community outreach and engagement

359
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:09.530
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so like. build that support for that site, and like build a vision for that site. So it's like particularly

360
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.159
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): discouraging to me to see where we are now.

361
00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:15.989
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So that was

362
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 2,016. Yeah.

363
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.989
Sarah Hofmeyer: Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like working on the ground and getting that going.

364
00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I went so

365
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.250
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): honestly. It was like before the lease was signed, and, like

366
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:42.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it, everything was a lot slower than it was supposed to be from the sale with the school district going through to like

367
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:53.530
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): at least like the lease agreement didn't end up getting signed until like end of 2,017, or maybe even 2,018. So it was 2,017, and then we started growing there in 2,018.

368
00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:06.290
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So I see. So I was. This was 2,016. I was doing this work so honestly like they were building out the the

369
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.420
the Thex Pod office space where we were supposed to move.

370
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and then

371
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.860
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 2

372
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:28.160
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like it just wasn't moving. So I was spending a lot of time like we we were like in a temporary office space out of pilgrim chapels like little annexed office space.

373
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:35.210
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We're trying to find nearby office space because they were going to charge us too much rent big in the building, even though we were

374
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): okay. It was just like it was really messy.

375
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:46.630
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and so there was like that aspect of it. And then a lot of like the on the ground work that's going to community association meetings like

376
00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:52.060
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): drawing a mile radius around that site and finding schools, finding businesses, finding

377
00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.750
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): neighbors that we're excited about this

378
00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.430
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and showing up and talking to them about about the vision and getting their input

379
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:10.530
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I sa all that, and and like we were working with the design firm to do this. This farmly on site layout.

380
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): everything changed.

381
00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.550
and and I just. I was burned out on the whole project. By the

382
00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.650
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): end of 2,016. I was also kind of

383
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.360
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): just ready for

384
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.840
for a change. And then the fact that

385
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): moving at that time

386
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.040
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): needed a break.

387
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.450
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah.

388
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:37.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and that's when you said you did. We worked at this environmental nonprofit for a while.

389
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:42.260
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I actually took about a year of like doing some random stuff, and then

390
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:55.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah work. And then I I got really through my work with one telephone got really involved with the Neighborhood Association and more kind of community development

391
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.730
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): neighborhood organizing.

392
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:03.800
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So I worked for an organization community capital fund for almost 2 years.

393
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.510
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and then went to bridging the gap.

394
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.010
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and that went back to

395
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that total time away was almost 5 years.

396
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:23.350
Sarah Hofmeyer: And so now what does like a day in your life at work look like

397
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.830
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): It's different every day

398
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:37.710
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like this afternoon. I'm. On the Steering Committee for the through Policy Coalition. So have a meeting with them a lot of meetings with partners.

399
00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:43.560
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and I'm. Part of a lot of different coalitions like the growing growers program

400
00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:57.420
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): sit on the coordinating team for that. So on the steering committee for through policy quotient. i'm on the point. They're all different names coordinating team for the regional food systems partnership program.

401
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): And then

402
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:11.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I i'm kind of shifting roles from more direct T, a. 2 more. and a strategy and partnership for the organization.

403
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.670
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So

404
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:19.770
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I but i'm still because we haven't rehired for for that direct tag role. I'm still.

405
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:25.140
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But we're seeing our Mini Grant program overseeing our cooperative orders

406
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.900
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): a lot of kind of direct support to growers.

407
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.200
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So i'm a little all over the place.

408
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:40.270
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but trying to focus more on on

409
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:42.850
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): policy and systems and

410
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.840
partnership.

411
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:52.270
Sarah Hofmeyer: Nice. That's exciting. It sounds really fulfilling like you have. You get to work with the farmers and work on the policy side.

412
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.600
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. yeah.

413
00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.510
Sarah Hofmeyer: when you're thinking about

414
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:08.330
Sarah Hofmeyer: policy. Sorry. I know this is a challenging question because we've talked about how every little municipality has their own policies.

415
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.250
Sarah Hofmeyer: Have you seen?

416
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:17.770
Sarah Hofmeyer: Have you seen any meaningful shifts in any of the other towns or cities surrounding Kansas City.

417
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:24.030
Sarah Hofmeyer: like what Kansas City, Missouri's done, or interest toward that in some of these coalitions.

418
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.530
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I don't know this like specifically. I just haven't gotten

419
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): in the last year since I've been back

420
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.630
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that hasn't been a focus. Yet

421
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:52.130
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): why not? County is for sure our next as an organization. The next place, we want to work, and we're we have a planner that's on board

422
00:39:54.610 --> 00:40:01.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to to work on stuff, but I think they've just had a lot transition, and they're trying to integrate it into more of a comprehensive plan.

423
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.530
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and that's just not moving quickly.

424
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.360
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So the things have been kind of stalled out.

425
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.950
Sarah Hofmeyer: Do you get the sense that city planners

426
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.280
Sarah Hofmeyer: have that value for urban Ag. In a in a way.

427
00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.790
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I would say city

428
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.680
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): planners do more than

429
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.200
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but

430
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:40.100
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it's I i'm at this point where I just i'm feeling pretty cynical about like developers are just gonna do what they're gonna do, and it doesn't matter what planners

431
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:51.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and what community fights for, and and so like there can be all these plans, and you can even have commissioners in place. You can like

432
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.240
It's just like well Developers still run, especially in

433
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:05.180
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): nobody's been willing to stand up to them. I mean, Casey, tennis is doing a lot of organizing.

434
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.440
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): standing up to developers and around more around housing.

435
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.920
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah.

436
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:22.750
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We've had a little bit of that in Lawrence as well. So it's just this this like I i'm just feeling particularly simple right now. So

437
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:28.380
Sarah Hofmeyer: I would be feeling that way, too. Given

438
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.670
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): neighborhood organizing work to

439
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.800
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): been involved in like.

440
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:41.220
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): There is a truce overlay in Kansas City, so it this section of troops, the neighborhood. Associations on

441
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:49.420
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): either side of that worked really hard to come up with this vision and guidelines and got it passed. So it's like

442
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.130
that overlay plan.

443
00:41:52.510 --> 00:42:00.140
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so it overrides like zone, like developers. Ha! Are legally required to comply with

444
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:07.710
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): the design guidelines and outlined in this place. and I was president of the Neighborhood Association

445
00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:09.650
and ended up being on that.

446
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.990
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Call it the Truth Coalition. Am I getting the names right

447
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.190
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): for that? Oversees

448
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.880
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): overlay?

449
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.690
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So I but it's like

450
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.040
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): developers are supposed to come to the

451
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:40.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we're supposed to review and make sure all their plans. Comply with this overlay, and, like they just do everything they can to get around it

452
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:52.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it. So it's just like seeing that, like having that lens. And then there was another big push along truce for

453
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.500
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): neighborhood and community input on developing this particular block.

454
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:02.060
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and then the developer is just do whatever they want like.

455
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.760
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So I don't know.

456
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.440
and that's not really speaking to any any particular question. But

457
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:14.110
Sarah Hofmeyer: but it's a really important factor. It sounds like

458
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:20.620
Sarah Hofmeyer: like the developer wants to do versus anything else.

459
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.710
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah.

460
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:27.530
Sarah Hofmeyer: Well, i'm sorry to

461
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:39.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): really bring out your inner. I like you back and forth between feeling like this work is so important. We have to fight and like, what's the point.

462
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.910
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah.

463
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.550
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So yeah.

464
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.190
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I've heard similar to the point.

465
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:58.230
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah, absolutely. I've heard similar sentiments from people who they don't really work so much in the policy side. They work more in like trying to get farms

466
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:07.110
Sarah Hofmeyer: out of the red, or trying to like scale up to the point where the local or regional food system is making money, and they, you know, just

467
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.780
Sarah Hofmeyer: it feels impossible, like such an uphill struggle constantly. So

468
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, I would. This is like another layer of policy

469
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:22.660
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): more on the kind of Federal programs.

470
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.060
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So we

471
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): been hearing a lot from like the Usda, the Nrcs and the Fsa.

472
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:38.170
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Like on a national level. There's this the new office for urban agriculture, and they're really pushing Urban Ag as a priority throughout the agency.

473
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): And so these agencies like

474
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.410
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): know that they. They need to be working with urban farmers.

475
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.900
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and are reaching out to organizations like us to

476
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:54.780
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like. Start those conversations. but they're still like.

477
00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:00.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So last week we hosted a workshop ABC's of Usd. And me with

478
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:06.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and you extension like creates the program, but wanted to partner with us. So it's

479
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.410
presentations from Nrcs

480
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:09.230
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): episode.

481
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:15.930
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and this is like the target audience is urban farmers that they're They know they're coming in and talking to.

482
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:22.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and they're still using examples from row, crop agriculture they're still using like

483
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:28.140
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like they they haven't other. The field staff on the ground like are not able to make

484
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:34.050
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that mindset switch. And they're talking about Zoom Phone programs. And

485
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:50.960
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so I think there's a really big opportunity. And like i'm feeling that, and seeing that to like start shifting like tiny drops of Federal resources that really would make a big impact in the viability of some of these urban farms and smaller scale.

486
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.180
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah.

487
00:45:53.410 --> 00:46:04.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): but it's just like how how to get these programs to a point where people can actually use them, and people can actually access that money. So I think there is a big opportunity

488
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.500
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): on

489
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:10.280
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): that we're starting to focus more on

490
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:18.760
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): a member of the national Sustainable Agriculture Coalition this year. which has been really great to

491
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.980
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to have more feel like there's more of a direct

492
00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.370
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): pathway to like have a voice. And

493
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:28.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): in that Federal policy where we're not like actually

494
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:34.210
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): doing the work. But we're like providing input to people who are who are having most

495
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:39.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): direct meetings on a daily basis. Total.

496
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:48.640
Sarah Hofmeyer: that's really exciting, too, because it's early enough. And I mean, I guess it's been several years now with the office of Urban Ag and innovative production, or whatever. But

497
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:55.980
Sarah Hofmeyer: it's early enough that it's really exciting that they might get the the information resources to

498
00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:02.160
Sarah Hofmeyer: shift their programming in a way that is more meaningful to urban farmers based on what you know and

499
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.810
Sarah Hofmeyer: national sustainable egg coalition are doing.

500
00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.810
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah. So

501
00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:14.470
Sarah Hofmeyer: So this makes you wonder with Federal programs and Federal agencies.

502
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:23.330
Sarah Hofmeyer: Then my question is about Grants, because so often, you know you have to do the applying for the grant to hopefully get that, and then pro

503
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:29.150
Sarah Hofmeyer: an initiative might last only as long as the Grant goes all those types of issues. But

504
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.240
Sarah Hofmeyer: have you had the chance to apply for grants

505
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.040
Sarah Hofmeyer: through Federal agencies? And what has that process been like?

506
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.760
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We have I? I don't do our ground writing so

507
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.950
so i'm very on the outside of it. But

508
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:57.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): cultivate has been fortunate to be in a position that, either through either as an organization or so, or

509
00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.230
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): through partnerships like with Catholic cherries on the new routes for refugees program.

510
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:15.730
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We have gotten a a a good number of Federal grants. There's like beginning Farmer and Rancher Grants 2501 focused on socially farmers right now. We haven't

511
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:26.420
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Nrcs cooperative agreement through another partner that wrote that Grant. We work on Federal Grants for our double up food books program Again, Another partner is writing that.

512
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.470
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So we

513
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:36.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): because we're a little bit bigger organization. We have been able to have access to Federal

514
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:43.650
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): grants, but those are targeted to nonprofits targeted to universities like more kind of

515
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:49.220
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): so funds are flowing to these institutions, but they're still not going like on the

516
00:48:50.120 --> 00:49:01.300
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): like commodity crop. Agriculture resources are available directly to farmers on the smaller scale. The resources are available to organizations, but not directly to the farmers. In the same way.

517
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.580
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): with the exception of like a few small things like

518
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.030
high time equip

519
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.520
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): current through cost shares for high tunnels.

520
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.510
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So I think that's that's one of the pieces that we're

521
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:23.850
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We're trying to figure out how we these Federal funds in the same, in a similar way that they're going directly to commodity.

522
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:29.700
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): How can you support economic viability of all scale farmers?

523
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:31.820
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, is a big

524
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:32.830
question

525
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.030
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): absolutely.

526
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:44.470
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): And and that's what I think a lot of the policy efforts are targeted at right now, because a lot of the programs are reimbursement based. So you have to be able to front the money.

527
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:49.570
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Do the project, implement the project and then wait for reimbursement from the Government

528
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:57.250
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): A lot of the programs it, even if farmers are eligible. But even smaller nonprofits

529
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.690
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): are.

530
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:09.690
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): they also require matching funds. So you apply for a $100,000. Grant you have to be able to come up with $25,000,

531
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): 25 or 50, or even one to one match.

532
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:19.460
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So that creates a huge barrier in making them accessible.

533
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.990
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah.

534
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.170
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah things that we're

535
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.870
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): thinking about in us.

536
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.510
It's for

537
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:40.350
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): other organizations and direct to farmers like. Okay, it's great. If these programs are out here. But if the types of farmers we work with

538
00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:44.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): can't actually use them like. how do we change that?

539
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.630
Sarah Hofmeyer: Yeah, Exactly. Exactly.

540
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:53.830
Sarah Hofmeyer: Did you work on? You said you mentioned that

541
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.050
Sarah Hofmeyer: you applied through the Kansas City Grant program for water for the long below.

542
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.640
Sarah Hofmeyer: What was that like for you?

543
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:12.110
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): That's a long time ago, but I actually now sit on the Review committee for that. Grant. So me I mean it's it's a more

544
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:16.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): straightforward application process than than any

545
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): it's designed for

546
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:24.680
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): small farms and gardens to be able to to do easily. But but there are still some

547
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.480
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): we need to make on.

548
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.210
But basically

549
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:32.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): either. So Kansas city community gardens administers that program.

550
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:42.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): We are a support on the urban farm side, so either a garden or a farm can apply. They submit a request through Kansas City Community garden sites.

551
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:50.820
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): If it's a farm it gets forwarded to me to do a water on it, so I have to go out. walk around the farm with them. talk about their meetings.

552
00:51:51.260 --> 00:52:01.070
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and basically write up a recommendation of like, Should they get a new tap? Should they do consider rain water catch me like, what are what are different options?

553
00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:12.120
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): So they have to get that water out of it and recommendation for them to apply. There's still, you know narrative questions. What are you doing?

554
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:26.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): They have to. It's from. And this is where I think we need like asking a farmer or a gardener to get multiple bids from plumbers

555
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:30.320
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): shouldn't seem that hard. But but

556
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:39.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): and they never respond, and they never show up when they say they're going to show up. So so that's one of the the areas that we're working on.

557
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.670
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Improving. The process is like

558
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:43.080
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): can.

559
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:50.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): because we basically send out a list of recommended. But then it's still on the the individual from the to

560
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.400
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to reach out.

561
00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:57.480
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Would it make more sense to collect all the applications? Send them all out

562
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.090
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): to the same list of

563
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:01.160
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): commerce.

564
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:13.720
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): All of them go detail level of detail. You probably don't need, but it it's something like i'm just trying to to find ways to make all of these processes

565
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.570
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): easier.

566
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.070
Sarah Hofmeyer: I really appreciate that. That's

567
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:21.270
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): what my discretion is really interested in.

568
00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:27.460
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): The compliance costs out. There are crazy. So I appreciate the attention of trying to reduce it.

569
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:33.340
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Have you heard about, or top to Greg Garbus

570
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.640
that's anybody?

571
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:36.920
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): No, I haven't

572
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): If you want an earful

573
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.020
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): about a good look.

574
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:49.310
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): He likes to. He's had. He's had a really tough time.

575
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.900
Sarah Hofmeyer: Do you think you could send me his contact information so I could send him an email.

576
00:53:55.650 --> 00:54:00.150
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): He doesn't really respond to anyone else. So could I call you

577
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:04.640
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I I i'm like what's that I I could text him for

578
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:12.340
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): I can give you my my phone number. Okay? Well, let me text him and see

579
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:21.660
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): is if he's willing to talk to you and then make a connection that'd be great. I was going to ask you as well if

580
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:29.290
Sarah Hofmeyer: and kind of starting with these interviews with public administrators or administrators of a sort, and trying to move on to

581
00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:46.140
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): either surveys or interviews with urban farmers to get in that experiential level of the learning compliance, psychological cost that they encounter. So, part of you a lot I was going to ask because I

582
00:54:46.140 --> 00:55:01.720
Sarah Hofmeyer: I've collected a lot of farm email addresses via all the directories that exist out there. It seems like a lot of people are coming together, which is really great to get those the list of where all the farms are located and whatnot. But I did want to ask you

583
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:07.880
Sarah Hofmeyer: if you'll be willing, you'd be willing to connect me with anyone who might have a good story to share.

584
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.540
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Yeah, I would, I would say.

585
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:19.560
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Greg, Amanda is a member of our staff who has

586
00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:26.620
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): work directly with the new roots graduates going through the city planning process, and she has a lot of

587
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.330
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): more. Do you know her.

588
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.870
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Amanda?

589
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:36.470
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Amanda Lind? All

590
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:45.010
Sarah Hofmeyer: great. Yeah, I went. I went through Cultivates website, and it was kind of like, oh, I feel like all of these people would have something interesting and different to talk about. So

591
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:53.230
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, it's true. But I think, yeah, I mean, it would be a good good next person I'm trying to think of.

592
00:55:54.530 --> 00:56:01.350
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): Let me think about it. I do need to run. I need to get over to a to this steering committee meeting.

593
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:03.450
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): But

594
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:11.030
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): yeah, if you want to send me the list of farmers you have, and I could flag some that I think would be good to talk to.

595
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:24.600
Sarah Hofmeyer: Absolutely. I can do that. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it talking to you. But yeah, i'll let you get going. I don't want to make you like to something different

596
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.740
Ami Freeberg, Cultivate KC  (she/her): on your project, and i'm also.
